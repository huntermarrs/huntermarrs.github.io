        Interview with Gerardo Vizmanos
    </div>
    <div class="desc-container">
        Known for his documentation of the male body and the practice of posing,
        the New York based photographer defines the human body as art apart from sexualization,
        though Instagram restrictive guidelines have been pushed on him more than once.

            <div class="col question">
                I have found it easy to point out your work due to your definitive
                aesthetic, how did you pursue photographing the nude body and
                refining your style?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                It was not something I particularly pursued. As many other photographers I
                started photographing friends and people relating to my regular live. I always
                found attracted to dance and body expression. Some of my friends were
                dancers and the option to shoot them nude came very naturally.
                Photographing nudity, like any other photograph, is very much about
                projecting ourselves. I think there is a lot of me on how I photograph nude
                bodies.
            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                Some viewers would say that your work is “erotic,” is that purposeful
                or do you believe that says something about the viewer themself?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                Both. I think the eroticism is always on the eyes of the beholder but there
                is also an inherent eroticism on the images, but often this is just one of the
                elements and often not the most important.
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                All of your works, especially Hidden Subject, document the male body
                with a lot of strength and vulnerability simultaneously. Could you
                explain your process of directing the subject and making them feel
                comfortable in such an exposed setting?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                Making the model comfortable is very much about personality and about how
                I connect with the person. I’m very interested on the people I work with and
                in engaging with them. The process is very smooth and natural. Not everyone
                feels the same way when they have to undress before a person for the first time
                and some people need more time than others. I like working with people who never
                posed nude before. It’s nice to see how quick they relax, and they forget they are nude.
                Often, they get very surprised how easy this is.
            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                There are a lot of personal underlying motifs in your work that you
                express through your subjects but never with your own self portraits,
                is there a reason for that?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                There is not a particular reason. I consider all my work a self-portrait, but on my absence.
                I’m not in the photos. I like to have control on the composition I can see on the viewfinder
                and I this is something I can’t control the same way if I’m before the camera and not behind.
                Maybe one day I try to be on the other side.
            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                How do you think the response to your work is different from media
                platforms like Instagram versus in print?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                Social media platforms don’t show context. A photograph like a word needs a context and
                someone who “speak” the language to be understood. When I post an image on Instagram,
                I have no information about the context. I don’t know where the viewer is and what the viewer
                is going to see before and after my image. The context of any post is subject to an algorithm.
                Social media is not about photography but about communicating things including photography.
                Social media is great to engage with many people it would be complicated otherwise but it’s
                terrible to show photographic works in a meaningful way.
            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                There have been a few instances where Instagram guidelines removed a
                post of yours, what are your thoughts on their guidelines and how in
                society all naked bodies seem to be instantly sexualized?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                Today Instagram guidelines has censorship in the way that they impose a control to
                what people can say and share, but the problem is not weather Instagram rules make sense
                or not but the concentration of traffic on Instagram. Four or five social media applications
                under the hands of the same instances have the control of almost all social media connections.
                There is no alternative to their rules. The traditional channels of publications and galleries
                are more restrictive today than before and the possibilities of people to engage with larger
                audiences out of these four or five platforms are near to zero. The problem of Instagram is
                not if the rules are good or bad. I don’t have particular concern with the rules themselves.
                The problem is that Instagram is the only voice and judge with no possibility for the people
                to say anything and they are out of the scrutiny of any control. The secret of democracy
                is having an effective separation of powers where one instance is control by not one but
                many others. Today Instagram is the closest thing to a dictatorship we have in our society
                when we refer to freedom of speech. We are good as long as we obey otherwise, we are “removed”.
            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                Along with that, how do you work around censorship and/or making it a
                point that your work should not be suppressed?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                I do nothing. I understood how the rules on Instagram work, and I accept it.
                It’s bigger than me individually. I simply don’t post my work on Instagram.
                I only post regular images to keep engaging with my audience, which is a part I really like.
                I have met amazing people on Instagram. I don’t want to miss that but I don’t think Instagram is
                the place to show work. Instagram is almost a dangerous place to show work. Recently I made
                a series of booklets showing my work with no restrictions and now I’m preparing two books
                and two new series of booklets. Unfortunately, because of the cost there are less opportunities
                to show work in gallery exhibitions and I think publishing is a really nice alternative to social
                media for the artists to show work and for those who admire the work of an artist to provide
                support by the small contribution of buying the publications. Not everyone can buy prints
                and even for those who can buy prints from time to time like to have access to publications
                where photographs can be seen in the right context.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instagram is a great tool to promote publications but not to show work.
                I often say that social media is today the TV of the 90’s. Lots of colors and lots of noise with
                lots of advertisement and some occasional great quality contents we don’t want to miss.
                If Instagram is good for communication, let’s use it for that.
            </div>
            <div class="col question">
                What are your thoughts on the “ideal body image” with society’s
                prominent use of social media? Do you think it has changed over time?
            </div>
            <div class="col2 answer">
                This is a complex issue. I think there have been significant changes but I’m not sure if they
                are enough or not in the right direction. Lots of young and not so young people seems to be obsessed
                with getting some ideal body image and this may cause harm and frustration. It’s not a question of
                how many “ideal bodies” are present on the market but how much people feel under pressure to emulate
                this or that. I think today there are more “ideal body” references in terms of shape, race or background
                than 10 years ago and this is great. I hope there are more in the future, but on the other hand,
                I think the pressure to emulate one ideal is much bigger today than before when the celebrities
                were on TV looking stratospheric to our ordinary lives. Today celebrities and models are on our phones doing
                “regular” things as we do and the temptation to feel the pressure to emulate them is bigger today than before.
